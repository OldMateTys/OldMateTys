## ✨ Welcome ✨

👨‍🔬 I am a CompSci/DataSci student at the University of Sydney

👴 At the ripe age of 25 I have now begun my journey into programming

🤓 After a misspent youth immersed in video games and spreadsheets

🌀 This knowledge is now being weaponised for proffessional gain.



🔎 Watch closely, big things are coming...
